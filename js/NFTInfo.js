The sound design intent was to capture the essence and behaviour of the sugar glider in the groove, bass and vibe and paint an audible picture of its day to day life. Enriched with beautiful melodies and sounds, a chilled out beat and cool energy. Sugar Glide is an emotive audible experience with a story. Tune in to glide along through this story. If you love Sugar Gliders this one is for you."
